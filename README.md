# Project Description

## Problem / Motivation

Currently, those who want to pass down their knowledge or skills have no choice but to share secret information directly — either orally or on paper.  
There is no verifiable way to record _who passed it to whom_, which makes extinction of such knowledge a real risk.

Traditional craftsmanship is disappearing globally not only because knowledge is lost, but because the act of transmission is invisible to institutions and future generations.  
Anchoring these successions on-chain — with auditable records and public funding mechanisms — makes cultural inheritance _visible_ and _preservable_.

Additional risks:

- Even though such cultural assets are meaningful and important to preserve, it is often unclear who contributed to their preservation.
- Historically sensitive knowledge is vulnerable to censorship by institutions or governments. Oral traditions can be altered, sanitized, or erased.

## Solution

- Record _who (wallet)_ passed knowledge to _whom (wallet)_ on-chain, preserving lineage and provenance.
- Encrypt content **client-side** so the knowledge itself remains private.
- Store encrypted data on IPFS; only its hash (CID) is referenced on-chain.
- Only the designated successor's wallet can derive the correct key to decrypt the content.
- This enables preservation of private cultural assets without forcing public disclosure.

## Target Users

- Individuals wanting to pass down secret or valuable knowledge _privately_.
- Examples:
  - the crypto ppl who wanna convey their knowledge to the next person. 
  - A restaurant owner with a secret recipe but no successor.
  - Craftsmen with unique techniques that cannot be publicized.
  - Oral storytelling traditions and local cultural narratives.
